    Context manager that receives a `django.template.Context` instance and a list of keys

    Once the context manager is exited, it removes `keys` from the context, to avoid
    side effects in later layout objects that may use the same context variables.

    Layout objects should use `extra_context` to introduce context variables, never
    touch context object themselves, that could introduce side effects.
